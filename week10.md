Construct-A-Vis: Exploring the Free-Form Visualization Processes of Children 
I want to emphasize this paper because it's directly related to our project. This one explains how a tablet game called Construct-A-Vis helps kids understand graphs better. 
In our project, we're also developing educational tools for children, so understanding how Construct-A-Vis works could be really helpful. 
This paper shows how the game engages kids in learning about data in a fun way. It's a good resource for us to consider as we work on our project.
