Using Infographics in the Teaching of Linguistics (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321955845_Using_Infographics_in_the_Teaching_of_Linguistics)
I chose this paper on using infographics in teaching linguistics because I find the intersection of visual design and education fascinating.
I wanted to understand how visual tools could help students grasp complex linguistic concepts in a more engaging and accessible way. 
The study's focus on Saudi female EFL students resonated with me, as it addresses a unique context and a diverse student group.
I was intrigued by the research questions exploring both the benefits and challenges of using infographics in an educational setting.
The large sample size and the comprehensive analysis using statistical methods gave me confidence in the paper's findings, which ultimately 
showed that infographics could positively influence learning while acknowledging some technical hurdles.
