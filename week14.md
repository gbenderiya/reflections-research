I chose this paper because it is related to our final project. 
It reviews 28 articles from 2010 to 2018 focused on data literacy in K-12 education, aiming to understand the current state of data literacy research. The study employed a systematic review method, sourcing articles from ERIC, Education Source, and JSTOR, with an emphasis on data literacy for K-12 teachers and leaders. Findings suggest that while data literacy has become more defined, there is still ambiguity surrounding its exact parameters, with schools of education primarily focusing on assessment literacy. The paper offers four recommendations: developing skill-oriented educator preparation programs, fostering collaborative opportunities, modeling data use from various sources, and exploring the impact of technology and big data on data literacy. Limitations include a narrow scope that might not fully represent all aspects of data-driven decision-making in K-12 education, while the originality lies in its potential to guide future research and training practices in the education sector.
